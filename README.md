# Node.js Express & PostgreSQL Shop Admin Panel

This project is a comprehensive backend solution designed for managing a shop's operations. Built with Node.js and Express, it leverages PostgreSQL as its database to provide robust data storage capabilities. The system is engineered to support a wide range of functionalities including authorization, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, search capabilities, pagination, and handling of relational data. An admin panel is included to facilitate the management of the shop's operations. Following the backend completion, a frontend application will be developed and integrated to offer a seamless user experience.

## Features

- **Authorization**: Secure access control to protect the management interfaces and APIs.
- **CRUD Operations**: Full capability to create, read, update, and delete resources efficiently.
- **Search**: Advanced search features to navigate through the shop's data easily.
- **Pagination**: Efficient data display and navigation through pagination.
- **Relations**: Comprehensive relational data management to represent complex data relationships.
- **Admin Panel**: A user-friendly admin panel for the shop's administrative tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 12.x or above)
- npm (version 6.x or above)
- PostgreSQL (version 12.x or above)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and update it with your PostgreSQL credentials and other configurations:

   ```plaintext
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=yourusername
   DB_PASS=yourpassword
   DB_NAME=yourdbname
   ```

5. Initialize the database (make sure PostgreSQL is running):

   ```bash
   npm run db:init
   ```

6. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Development

### Adding New Features

When adding new features or making changes, create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-new-feature
```

After development, push your branch and create a pull request.

### Running Tests

To ensure quality and functionality, run tests frequently:

```bash
npm test
```

## Deployment

Instructions for deploying to a live server will vary depending on the hosting provider and environment. Typically, you would set environment variables on your server to match those in your `.env` file and use a process manager like PM2 for Node.js applications.

## Building the Frontend

Details on the frontend application development and its integration will be provided in a subsequent phase of the project.
